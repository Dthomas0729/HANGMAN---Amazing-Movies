# HANGMAN MOVIES EDITION
A simple hangman game played inside the command line or terminal

## 1st Solo Project
* This beginner project was started to develop and practice my coding skills with the python language. 

## O.O.P.
* To better understand Object Oriented Programming I changed the code structure to incorporate classes instead of a script full of functions.
